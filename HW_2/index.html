    <h2>Solar System</h2>

    <p class="article_text" >The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it. 
    It formed 4.6 billion years ago from the gravitational collapse of a giant interstellar molecular cloud. 
    The vast majority (99.86%) of the system's mass is in the Sun, with most of the remaining mass contained in 
    the planet Jupiter. The planetary system around the Sun contains eight planets. The four inner system 
    planets—Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars—are terrestrial planets, being composed primarily of rock and metal. 
    The four giant planets of the outer system are substantially larger and more massive than the terrestrials. 
    The two largest, Jupiter and Saturn, are gas giants, being composed mainly of hydrogen and helium; the next 
    two, Uranus and Neptune, are ice giants, being composed mostly of volatile substances with relatively high 
    melting points compared with hydrogen and helium, such as water, ammonia, and methane.
     All eight planets have nearly circular orbits that lie near the plane of Earth's orbit, called the ecliptic.</p>

        <img class="img_moon" src="./img/moon.jpg" alt="The Moon">

        <p class="article_text"> The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It is the fifth largest satellite in
            the Solar System and the largest and most massive relative to its parent planet,[f] with a 
            diameter about one-quarter that of Earth (comparable to the width of Australia). 
            The Moon is a planetary-mass object with a differentiated rocky body, making it a satellite 
            planet under the geophysical definitions of the term and larger than all known dwarf planets 
            of the Solar System. It lacks any significant atmosphere, hydrosphere, or magnetic field. 
            Its surface gravity is about one-sixth of Earth's at 0.1654 g, with Jupiter's moon Io being 
            the only satellite in the Solar System known to have a higher surface gravity and density. </p>
